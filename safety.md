# SAFETY REMINDER

1. Please do not click links in DMs - mods will never message you directly via DM. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is a scam.

2. If you haven't already, disable DMs from server members by clicking the drop down next to the server name in the top left > Privacy Settings > Disable Messages from Server Members. This will save you from a bunch of spam.

3. DO NOT CLICK on "Hidden NFTs" in your Opensea account. Those are most likely airdropped NFTs that will try to gain access to your account and steal everything if you click and/or approve of any transactions through them. Just leave them alone.
