Nothing stated here is financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing into anything

What is an NFT?
- An NFT is a unique digital asset. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. 

Can’t I Just Screenshot it?
- Yes. You can screenshot an NFT, but this does not give you the capabilities to buy and sell the NFT on the blockchain. Think of baseball cards for a comparison. They can be copied, but only the originals are rare. The same principle can be applied to NFTs.

What is Minting and how do I Mint an NFT?
- Minting an NFT means you are the first owner of it. This is done on a project’s website, and is usually not very expensive to do. 
- Once you mint an NFT, nobody can mint your specific NFT. They would have to buy it from you on secondary. 

What is a Whitelist?
- A whitelist gives you access to a guaranteed, but not free, mint. This is basically just a presale. 

What is a Gas Fee?
- Gas fees are what the majority of Ethereum transactions require in order to process them. These cannot be refunded and do not go to the seller or buyer, they go to the Ethereum miners who provide the necessary equipment to verify transactions and keep the network running.

How To Purchase an NFT

1. Make a cryptocurrency account. Coinbase is the most popular, but other sufficient crypto wallets include Binance and Uphold. 

2. Purchase the respective cryptocurrency that you need to buy the NFT you desire. For example, Space Pals is on the Ethereum blockchain, so you would want to buy Ethereum for this. 

3. Make a digital wallet. Meta Mask is the most popular, but Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet, are also used. You will want to make sure to remember your login details and an 8-12 word seed phrase. If you lose this seed phrase, your account is gone forever. NEVER SHARE THIS SEED PHRASE WITH ANYONE. If someone has access to this seed phrase, they can steal everything in your digital wallet including cryptocurrencies and your NFTs. 

4. Once you have a crypto account (Coinbase), and a digital wallet (Meta Mask) you will be able to transfer crypto from one to the other. You’ll want to send X amount of crypto from your Coinbase to your Meta Mask. Make sure to account for network fees, gas fees, and royalties before sending less crypto than you need and having to send more crypto, and pay fees twice. 

5. After you have your crypto currency in your digital wallet (Meta Mask) you are all set to buy an NFT. You will need to pay royalties (0-10%) to the project owner, gas fee to miners, as well as a small royalty (0-5%) to the network you purchase the NFT on. For example, Opensea has a 2.5% royalty.

6. To SELL an NFT, you repeat this process in reverse. You simply press “sell”, select a ‘buy now’ price, or do a timed auction. People can also bid on your NFT when it’s not for sale, and you can accept these bids. Be aware that you will need to pay royalties and a gas fee for this sale.

How do I Avoid Scams?
- First and foremost, NEVER share your seed phrase with anyone. NEVER screenshare your if you are looking at anything related to your account details. 
- Turn off all discord DMs. If you need to get in touch with somebody, they can send you a friend request. Many projects unfortunately encounter cyber attacks where people join their servers and send malicious links to server members offering free or early mints that looks legitimate, but will instead steal your crypto and NFTs. 
- NEVER CLICK ANY LINKS FROM ANYBODY. These can be IP grabbers, malicious software, etc. Personal information, crypto, and NFTs can be easily stolen this way. 
- Only click links that are sent by moderators and team members under official link channels.
- Invest in a hardware wallet called a Ledger. This is a “cold” wallet that you can transfer your assets, both crytpo, and NFTs to, to keep them safe from hackers.
